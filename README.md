# Reverse Auction App

A full-stack reverse auction platform built with Next.js (TypeScript) and Tailwind CSS.  
Users can register, log in, and place bids â€” the lowest bid wins.  
Firebase is used for authentication, Firestore for real-time bidding and data storage.  
The UI is fully responsive with smooth animations and toast feedback.  
Authentication and bid logic are handled via Firebase triggers and context.  
Built using the App Router and deployed as a complete working application.
